# NUVR/Engage Website

This repository is designed to contain all of the code for our https://nuvr.github.io/ website in plain HTML form. While it can be added to [Engage](https://neu.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/virtual-reality-organization-of-northeastern-university), these pug templates have to be split into individual files for uploading.

## Contributing

The default branch is the `dev` branch since we are limited to GitHub Pages deploys on the [master](https://github.com/NUVR/nuvr.github.io/tree/master) branch. There is a CircleCI configuration that will automatically grab commits from this branch to deploy onto master. All other branches will be ignored.
