# NUVR/Engage Website

This repository is designed to contain all of the code for our https://nuvr.github.io/ website in plain HTML form. While it can be added to [Engage](https://neu.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/virtual-reality-organization-of-northeastern-university), these pug templates have to be split into individual files for uploading.

## Contributing

The default branch is the `dev` branch. Builds will automatically be published upon a commit to this branch per the `publish` job in our GitHub workflow.
